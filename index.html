        Bagel Day is a weekly get-together at Tom Hughes's home. On select Saturdays he gets up around 6AM, makes a few dozen bagels and brews some coffee. Stop by. That's it. <br /><br />
        Guidelines:<br />
1. Everyone is welcome. <br />
2. No work talk.<br />
3. No requests. <br />
4. You have to leave at noon.<br />
5. There is Mario Kart and sometimes a jigsaw puzzle.<br />
