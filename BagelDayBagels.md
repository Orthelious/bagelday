Yields 16-24 bagels   
Time: About 3 hours  

This recipe is essentially the water bagels recipe from [King Arthur Flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/bagels-recipe). I've added baking soda to the water bath and I have made some slight changes to the instructions — so I'm calling this recipe mine. 

## *Ingredients*

**Dough**

* 8 C — (964g) Bread Flour 
* 2 T — [Active Dry Yeast](https://redstaryeast.com/products/red-star/red-star-active-dry-yeast/)
* 2 T — Brown Sugar (or [Non-Diastatic Malt Powder](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/non-diastatic-malt-powder-16-oz))
* 4 t — Salt (I use Morton's Kosher Salt)
* 2 3/4C — 3C Lukewarm Water (changes based on humidity in your kitchen)

**Water Bath**

* 2 qt — Water
* 2 T — Brown Sugar (or [Non-Diastatic Malt Powder](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/non-diastatic-malt-powder-16-oz) or honey)
* 1 T — Granulated Sugar
* 1 1/2 T — Baking Soda*

*Some people "[bake the baking soda](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/dining/15curious.html)" to make it extra alkali. 

## *Instructions*

1. In a stand mixer (or by hand in a bowl) mix all the dry ingredients with the exception of the salt. Add water and start kneading. About 2-3 minutes into kneading, add the salt. 

2. Knead for 10-15 minutes, it really takes a while. The dough should feel very smooth and not have any lumps. If it's wet and sticky, there's too much water.   
3. Set in a greased bowl and cover with greased plastic wrap for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. The dough will double in size. 
4. Remove plastic wrap, punch down dough and turn out on to work surface. Divide into 24 lumps for regular to small bagels, 16 for big and healthy bagels. If you don't divide the dough, it is possible to make one, giant bagel (otherwise known as [The Bigel](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtqdfVQhIL-/))
5. Fold each piece of dough into a little ball and roll on counter to create a tight surface ([watch this video on chef steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2OptU3CBfk&feature=youtu.be))
6. Set dough balls on greased parchment paper and under plastic wrap for ten minutes. During this time, start bringing the water bath to a very low, simmering boil and preheat the oven to 450-500. 
7. Poke holes in dough ball and stretch to form into donuts. Place back under plastic wrap for twenty minutes. They'll get puffy.
8. Working 4-6 at a time, gently boil the bagels for 1 minute on each side. Transfer to a drying rack to drain off any excess liquid, and place on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake them in the oven for 20-25 minutes. Optional: coat the baking sheet with corn meal for a crunchy bottom.
9. Let them cool completely before slicing open. 
10. Store in a paper bag for a half day, plastic bag if longer. They go stale pretty quickly. 

* **For toppings:**
	- After boiling and while bagels on draining on the rack, brush bagels with egg wash (1 beaten egg, 1T water) and sprinkle on toppings (poppy seed, sesame seeds, etc)
